# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge

   Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.
    The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
    The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
    Combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to LEFT JOIN logic.
